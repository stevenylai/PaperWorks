Although there are several works on providing event-based services in WSN, most of them can only deal with primitive event types and have limitation when handling composite event types. In a type-based event system, event types are defined by specifying their attributes and filters. Events are then filtered according to such type information. Moreover, composite event types may be defined by combining multiple event types with operators. Due to the resource constraints in WSN, composite events are much more difficult to manage than primitive events. In this paper, we introduce PSWare, a type-based publish / subscribe middleware for WSN that supports composite events. We describe our design for PSWare. PSWare has a flexible architecture where different composite event detection algorithms may be easily integrated. Based on our implementation, we study several applications scenarios for PSWare and demonstrate how PSWare can help in developing these applications and evaluating their performance.
