\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented PSWare, a pub/sub middleware for composite events. PSWare uses a flexible architecture where different event detection mechanisms may easily integrated. We described our design for PSWare. Based on our implementation, we performed experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of PSWare for application prototyping and performance comparison.
