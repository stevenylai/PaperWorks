\textbf{Assignment}&{In the last week, we have achieved following results:
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item Finish the software design of localization system.
    \item Conduct localization experiment in outside environment.
  \end{enumerate}
}\\
\hline
\textbf{Effort}&{CZ revised the algorithm and we have conducted localization experiments outside the Hong Kong coliseum. The size of experiment area is \(40x15m^2\).}\\
\hline
\textbf{Achievement}&{We have finished localization experiments in large-scale outside environment and got high localization accuracy (the average localization error is 0.52m). Please refer to the appendex "Report for s-Helmet" for details.}\\
