\subsection{Smart Cushion}

Sitting posture particularly poor posture greatly influences one's health and in-creases the risk of developing upper limb and neck disorder. Therefore, it is greatly desirable to develop a system that recognise user¡¯s sitting postures, and then generate alerts for poor postures. Current solutions for sitting posture recognition either use intrusive wearable/visual sensors or rely on expensive high-resolution pressure sensor array, and thus limiting their usability and widespread deployment.
The objective of this project is to develop a sitting posture recognition system that is accurate, non-intrusive and low-cost. In specific, the proposed system is able to accurately infer a set of common sitting postures based on a few number of pres-sure sensors deployed on the seat cushion. This project introduces two main innovations. First, we propose a set of user-invariant and distinctive features to model sitting posture, which improves the recognition accuracy. Second, we conduct a systematic research on the optimal sensor placement with respect to different sitting posture sets, achieving the balance between system accuracy and cost.
