\subsection{Intelligent Transportation System Demo}

We have a platform to demonstrate our existing research results in intelligent transportation system, which include the following topics:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item WSN-assisted Collision avoidance
  \item Demand-oriented intelligent traffic light control
  \item WSN-assisted tracking system
  \item WSN-assisted tracking system
\end{enumerate}

The platform must be reliable and stable during the show. The previous implementation was based on the now obsolete and unmaintained TinyOS 1.x so these programs are gradually being ported to TinyOS 2.x for the sake of long-term benefit. We have already ported the following TinyOS 1.x applications:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The TinyOS application running on each car
  \item The TinyOS application running on the traffic lights
  \item The Java application running on the gateway PC
\end{enumerate}
