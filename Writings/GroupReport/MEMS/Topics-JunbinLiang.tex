Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are very small devices with mechanical and electrical components. MEMS have some abilities such as sensing, actuating, communicating or moving. Distributed intelligent MEMS (DiMEMS) are composed of thousands
or even millions of single MEMS units, which raise new
scientific challenges both for controlling and for programming
such large ensembles.

Declarative programming (DP) provides an easy to use language paradigm to the programmers.
In DP, a programmer just needs to specify the high-level logic of $what$ to do, and
leaves the low-level implementation of $how$ to do for the compiler.

However, it is non-trivial to generate an execution plan to large amount of DiMEMS units, especially
the plan is constrained by a time limit. We research how to generate an execution plan that satisfies corresponding time constrain among the DiMEMS
units, so as to enable the whole DiMEMS system achieve its goal in real time.

In this topic, we mainly have three research objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To design a real-time execution plan generation algorithm for DiMEMS applications.
  \item To design an energy efficient routing scheme for interaction of multiple DiMEMS units.
  \item To design an execution plan scheduling mechanism to support the implementation of temporal logic.
\end{enumerate}
