\subsection{Searching and Browsing Cyber-Physical Objects}

Increasing deployment of smart sensors makes our living environment more intelligent. And the information explosive growth result people immerse into the marine information. In our imagination, to ease the burden of people, make the information in cyber space and objects in physical space both searchable can be useful. And searching and browsing cyber-physical objects is potentially to promote the social progress.

We propose to design a framework consisting of architecture, algorithms and mechanisms to enable people to acquire and organize the desired information about objects in the integrated cyber and physical worlds (hereafter called cyber-physical objects), and to navigate from one object to others through their contextual links.

In this topic, we mainly have three research objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To model the cyber-physical objects and their relationship.
  \item To design a scheme to efficiently take out the relationship inference.
  \item To design a cyber-physical objects related information storage and index scheme, make it efficiency for searching the information.
  \item To design a algorithm for accurately sort the search result for the customer.
\end{enumerate}
