Although there are several works on providing event-based services in WSN, most of them could not handle composite events. Composite events consist of multiple primitive events with strong temporal and spatial relations and are much more difficult to manage. In this paper, we proposed PSWare, a publish/subscribe middleware framework that supports composite events. PSWare uses a flexible architecture where different event detection and delivery mechanisms may be easily integrated. We demonstrate how PSWare can help application development by studying some real examples. Extensive experiments were carried out for these applications. The result show PSWare can be effective when comparing the performance of different event detection algorithms.
