\begin{abstract}
A lot of web-based demos and web applications are currently hosted by WSN group in QT405. Because these applications were developed by different people (some have left our group) with different programming language, it is necessary to have a solid document on these systems. This document summarizes the current applications, their statuses and instructions on how to use or modify them. It also provides guidelines for the development of future demos so that they can work correctly on the server and easily get along with the existing ones.

For a quick view of the existing applications, please go to Section \ref{sec:overview}. If you want to upgrade existing softwares on the server, please go to Section \ref{sec:environment}. If you are working on a new project, please refer to Section \ref{sec:hints} for some hints. If you are looking for how to maintain your source codes, please read Section \ref{sec:source} and \ref{sec:svn}. If you are showing demos to visitors, please go to Section \ref{sec:procedure} for procedures.
