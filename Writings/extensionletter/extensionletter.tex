\opening{Dear Research Office,}

I am writing to apply to extend my PhD normal period. Though I have finished a draft for my thesis and have made a lot of modifications on my paper, I had a small accident the week before last - the hard disk which contained my papers, my thesis and my demonstration programs were broken down and at first, I could not read anything out of it. I had a hard time looking for solutions on how to restore the data. Fortunately, now I have found a tool that can restore the data. However, more work still need to be done to recover everything.

I expect to finish and submit my thesis by no more than three months (Sept 22, 2012). During this three month's time, I will spend the first month (June 23 - July 22) for reinstalling the program and restore all my paper works. In addition, I will also discuss with my supervisor about the sections that I have modified since our last discussion. Then I will spend the second month (July 23 - Aug 22) on finalizing and submitting the paper. I will use the third month (Aug 23 - Sept 22) to integrate the new paper content into my thesis. I will appreciate it if you can extend my study period. Meanwhile, I will keep working hard on my papers.

\closing{Regards,}
