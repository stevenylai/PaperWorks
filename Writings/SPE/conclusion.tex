\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented PSWare, a flexible middleware framework for composite events processing. PSWare uses a flexible architecture where different event detection mechanisms may easily integrated. We described the design of PSWare and explained how it can be customized for different applications. Then we gave two examples of using PSWare. The first one implements a more general composite event algorithm while the second one uses an application-specific event detection approach. Based on our implementation, we performed experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of PSWare for prototyping and performance comparison.
