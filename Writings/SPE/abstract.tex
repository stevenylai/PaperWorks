Many WSN applications such as intelligent transportation systems, smart building and intelligent car park are event-based in the sense that these applications require specifying, detecting and delivering events which are of users' interest and may trigger necessary actions. However, developing event-based applications is challenging because of two reasons. First, it is difficult to specify and detect composite events. Second, different applications may have different requirements for event processing such as communication reliability, network life time or delay bound. In this paper, we propose PSWare, a publish/subscribe middleware that supports composite event processing. It provides a declarative event definition language for the users to specify the composite events. It also facilitates easy configuration of different event processing algorithms and integrate them into the system at run time. We demonstrate the features of PSWare in supporting application development by showing several real application examples. Extensive experiments were carried out and the results show that PSWare is an effective toolkit to develop high performance event based WSN applications.
