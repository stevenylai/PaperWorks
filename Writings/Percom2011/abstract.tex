Although there are several works on providing event-based services in WSN, most of them have limited support to handle composite events. Composite events consist of multiple primitive events with strong temporal and spatial relations and are much more difficult to manage. In this paper, we propose CEDU (Composite Event Detection using event fUsion), a distributed composite event detection algorithm. The essential idea of CEDU is event fusion, where some sensor nodes are selected as fusion points. Then component events will fused for the detection of a high level event according to the event definition. Event fusion with minimum energy cost is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, CEDU takes a distributed randomized approach. We analyze the properties of CEDU to show both its effectiveness and efficiency. By carrying out real world experiments on CEDU, we show that CEDU can reduce the energy cost by 10-20\% in many typical WSN-based applications compared with na\"{i}ve event detection mechanism where the event relations are not considered.
