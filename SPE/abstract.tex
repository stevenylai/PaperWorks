Many WSN applications such as intelligent transportation systems, smart building and intelligent car park are event-based. However, event-based applications are difficult for programming because of the dynamic environment and resource constraints. To make the development easier for these applications, we need a middleware for event processing. In this paper, we propose PSWare, a publish/subscribe middleware framework that supports processing of dynamic events. PSWare uses a flexible architecture where different event detection and delivery mechanisms can be easily integrated. We demonstrate how PSWare can help application development using real application examples. Extensive experiments were carried out for these applications. The results show PSWare can be used as an effective toolkit to develop WSN-based applications.
