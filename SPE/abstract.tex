Many WSN applications such as intelligent transportation systems, smart building and intelligent car park are event-based in the sense that these applications require specifying, detecting and delivering events which are of users' interest and may trigger necessary actions. However, developing event-based applications is challenging because of two reasons. First, it is difficult to specify and detect composite events. Second, different applications may have different requirements for event processing such as communication reliability, network life time or delay bound. In this paper, we propose PSWare, a publish/subscribe middleware that supports composite event processing. It provides an event definition language so that the users may easily specifying the composite events. In addition, different event processing algorithms may be easily configured and integrated into the system at run time. We demonstrate how PSWare can help application developers by showing several real application examples. Extensive experiments were carried out for these applications. The results show PSWare can be used as an effective toolkit to develop event-based WSN applications.
