Dear Editors,

I am writing to submit my paper, titled 'Towards Energy Efficient Composite Event Detection for Wireless Sensor Network' for considering for publication. This paper is an extension to our previous paper, 'TED: Efficient Type-based Composite Event Detection for Wireless Sensor Network', which was published in DCOSS 11. It has the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We formulate the problem of type-based composite event detection and prove it NP-complete.
  \item We propose a centralized event detection algorithm as well as a distributed one, namely TED to the type-based composite event detection problem.
  \item We validated our algorithms through analysis, simulations and experiments. The results show the energy efficiency of TED in event-based WSN applications.
\end{itemize}

In addition, this paper is different from the previous one in the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item It provides the detailed proof on why the general composite event detection problem is NP-complete.
\item In addition to the distributed algorithm, a centralized version of TED is proposed. The centralized algorithm is also analyzed and compared with the distributed version.
\item As one of the essential component of our algorithm, the fusion point placement problem, we propose a hierarchical scheme. We evaluated the new scheme.
\end{itemize}

Regards,
