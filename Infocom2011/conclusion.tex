\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper,we proposed a cluster-based modal analysis approach. The clustering problem in this approach is formulated and proven to be NP-complete.  Two centralized and one distributed algorithms are proposed. Through simulation and experiment data, the efficiency of this cluster-based modal analysis along with the clustering algorithms have been demonstrated. Compared with traditional approach where all the data are transmitted to a central unit, the proposed approach is much more energy efficient and has great promise to be applied to WSN-based SHM.
