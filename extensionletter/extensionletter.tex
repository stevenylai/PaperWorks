\opening{Dear Research Office,}

I am writing to apply to extend my PhD normal period. Though I have finished a draft for my thesis, my current paper for my research project still needs some modification. Last time when I met my supervisor, he pointed out several important aspects that I should improve for my paper including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Highlight the features of my research work in the beginning of the paper including support for composite event and flexibility
\item Modify the existing section to emphasize the composite event processing feature
\item Add a new section dedicated to describing the flexibility
\item Merge the application study cases into one section and discuss them according to the distinct features provided by my work
\end{itemize}

I have modified my paper accordingly but there is still some work left, mostly related to performance evaluation part. I think it is necessary to spend more time so that I can fully address the above issues so that the quality of both my paper and my thesis may be improved.

I expect to finish and submit my thesis by no more than three months (June 22, 2012). During this three month's time, I will spend the first month (March 23 - April 22) on further polishing the paper. Then the second month (April 23 - May 22) to have more meetings with my supervisor and make modifications accordingly. I will use the third month (May 23 - June 22) to integrate the new paper content into my thesis. I will appreciate it if you can extend my study period. Meanwhile, I will keep working hard on my papers.

\closing{Regards,}
