The paper has certain degree of originality. The authors proposed their own watermark embedding and extraction method for digital audio.

The main contribution of the paper is the proposed watermark embedding and extracting method. Experiments have been performed on the proposed methods.

Literature survey is generally OK. A number of watermark embedding methods are listed. In particular, some DCT-based approaches are discussed in more details.

Watermark embedding / extraction for digital audio.

The problem is a well-defined and has been studied by others. No additional assumptions are used by the authors.

Not discussed in the paper but scalability probably isn't a major concern for watermark embedding / extration either.

The proposed watermark embedding and extracting method is described in details and experiments have been performed.

The paper should not be considered as a scientific work because it lacks analytical results and comparison. In particular:
1. There are many existing works discussed by the authors but there is no comparison.
2. While there are experimental results, it would be better if the author could analytically quantify the improvements of their algorithm.
3. Some equations (in Results section) do not show clearly.
