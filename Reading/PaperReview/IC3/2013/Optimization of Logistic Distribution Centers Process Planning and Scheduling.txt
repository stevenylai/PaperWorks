The paper has certain degree of originality and addresses a problem in the area of operation research

1. To describe the problem of logistic and warehousing companies
2. To describe a set of benchmarks and to give the reference layout of the warehouse
3. To present a baseline results obtained by a genetic programming algorithm

Related works in OR and GA are reviewed

Minimize the operation time for logistic distribution centers

Some layout definitions of logistic warehouses. According to the paper, these are consulted from logistic companies.

Compared with mathematical programming, genetic algorithm are supposed to be more scalable in tackling larger optimization problems

1. Problem is well-defined
2. Paper is well organized
3. Results are given

It might be more interesting if the paper can give more analytical results on the number of generations needed to obtain a solution.
