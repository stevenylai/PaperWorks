The originality of the paper is questionable. While security in WSN may be an issue, data mining is a well-studied topics.

Anomaly detection in WSN

All the traffic data in WSN must be available to run the data mining algorithm. This may be impractical in real scenario especially for resource constraint environment like WSN

Not discussed

The proposed approach has been discussed and evaluation has been performed

The main weakness of the proposed approach is that all the traffic data must be available to run the algorithm. While this may be a reasonable assumption in wired networks, it is probably impractical in the context of WSN where the nodes are very resource-constrained.
