The originality of the paper is not clear because the essential idea behind the proposed approach is to use fragile watermarking which is an existing technique used to data integrity.

Use fragile watermarking in Visual Cryptography for detecting tampered shares.

Literature survey is not sufficient because the paper discussed very few related works in VC. And yet the paper's main objective is to detect tampered shares in VC

The problem is to detect tampered shares in VC via fragile watermarking. However, fragile watermarking is a general method for checking data integrity, so it's not clear why the problem is different in the context of VC.

Not applicable

Not discussed and probably not very important in the application of VC

Applied fragile watermarking for detecting tampered share in VC. The algorithm is discussed and evaluation is performed.

1. Literature review is weak (see my comments for literature survey).
2. The problem is unclear (see my comments for problem)
3. The evaluation is weak - there's no comparison or analytical results.
