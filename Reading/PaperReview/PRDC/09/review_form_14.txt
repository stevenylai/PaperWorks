This paper presents a new data aggregation protocol called early-stopping protocol for WSN. The protocol is claimed to be time-optimal in presence of failures. The basic idea of the protocol is to combine hierarchical data aggregate and non-hierarchical data aggregate. The nodes are divided into slug nodes and delegate nodes. Delegated nodes will compute the result based on the input from slug nodes. The authors also analyzed the performance of their protocol. However, the paper has the following problems:
1.	The notations used are not clear. There are a lot of notations with many dots in them but the authors didn¡¯t give detailed explanations
2.	In order to make the work more convincing, the authors should implement or at least simulate their protocol. However, in the paper, the authors only gave theoretic analysis
3.	The organization of the protocol can be improved. Instead of mixing the pseudo codes with the analysis, the authors should first give a high-level overview of the protocol.
4.	There is no comparison with the existing works. Even though the authors mentioned a lot of existing works. None of them are compared.
5.	There are some typos in the paper such as ¡®The spanning tree is used to collect and gradually aggregate the input-values at each level of the tree, relying (relaying) ¡­¡¯ on the third page.
In summary, the idea of the protocol is interesting. However, because of the problems mentioned above, it¡¯s difficult to appreciate the contribution of the paper.
