\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented CEDU, a distributed composite event detection algorithm for WSN. We prove that the composite event detection problem is NP-complete. Therefore, CEDU consists of a set of randomized algorithms to forward the events and select fusion points. We have derived some important theorems regarding to the performance of CEDU. By making use of the event fusion points, CEDU can detect composite events in an energy efficient fashion in many WSN applications. We analyzed the performance of CEDU and compared it with opportunistic data aggregation where events are aggregated without considering their event relations. We have also done some real experiments on CEDU to show its performance.

There are still a lot of open issues regarding to CEDU. One of them is how to select fusion points, in this paper, we assume that the users have no prior knowledge about the events that will happen in the network. Therefore, the fusion points are randomly selected. However, in the real world, this may not always be the case so the performance of CEDU may be further improved if we can select the fusion points in a smarter way.
